First actually set A (we'll check later that nobody messed it up)
@example
A = 5
@result{} A = 5
@end example

@example
A = 10   # doctest: +SKIP
@result{}
@end example

@example
A = 10       @c doctest: +SKIP
@result{}
A = 10       @comment doctest: +SKIP
@result{}
@end example

Ensure A is still 5 (none of the skipped tests ran)
@example
A
@result{} A = 5
@end example
